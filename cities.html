        <h3>Cities I have lived</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Madhira &#127470;&#127475;</b></li>
            <li><b>Vijayawada &#127470;&#127475;</b></li>
            <li><b>Bangalore &#127470;&#127475;</b></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="citieslived">Despite, I was born in jaggayapeta, I was raised in madhira and attended my school upto 10th standard over there. My family and friends are there. For me everything is so special in madhira. I love our home(poes garden) very much. This city has all my childhood memories. 
           The next city I admire most is Vijayawada, where I have spent 6 years over there and finished my high school and undergraduation. The best thing I like in vijayawada for it's natural beauty, The krishna river, The mountains, it's rich heritage and especially my university campus and vicinity around the campus.
           I love Bangalore for my job opporunity and the freedom the city offers to every individual to explore.

        <h3>Cities I would like to visit</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Singapore &#x1f1f8;&#x1f1ec;</b></li>
            <li><b>Hong Kong &#x1f1ed;&#x1f1f0;</b></li>
            <li><b>Maldives &#x1F1F2;&#x1F1FB;</b></li>
        </ol>
        <p class="citieslived">
            Ever since I watched the movie of crazy rich asians and after studying kevin kwan's two extended novels of crazy rich asians, I became fascinated
            towards singapore and hongkong and their rich heritage. so, I would like personally visit those places and experience the culture. Maldives is known for it's beautiful beaches, Indians who were 
            bored with goa beaches would go there and enjoy. I wish I could visit that place and experience those beaches.
